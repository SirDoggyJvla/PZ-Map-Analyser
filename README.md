# Map Analyser
This tool allows anyone with Python to list their available maps in their downloaded Workshop maps for Kentucky, KY. You can simply launch the code, reference your workshop `.../108600` folder for Project Zomboid and every maps will be listed. You can then check which maps you want to activate and if maps share cells, those cells will be highlighted as well as their maps in the list.

Simply run `app.py`.
